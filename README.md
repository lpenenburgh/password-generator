# Password-generator
Homework 3

## Goals
My goal for this assignment is to create a functional password generator using JavaScript. The password generator will take user input to create a randomized password made up of letters, numbers, and special characters.

### Methods for achieving goals
* How I ensured my JS code was functioning properly:
    * To ensure there were no errors, as I was building my js code, I frequently used console.log  to check my work in the webpage console, in Chrome DevTools, making sure no errors were occuring along the way that would interfere with the code running.
* How I got and stored user input to create a randomized password:
    * Created variables consisting of every type of character that could potentially go into the password.
    * Interacted with the user by creating prompts and alerts that store the users input in an object and arrays.
    * randomized potential characters using "Math.floor(Math.random()".
    * Used conditional statements and for-loops .
    * Used "querySelector", ".value", and "addEventListener" to present the user with the randomized password written on the page.
